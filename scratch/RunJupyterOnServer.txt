cd ~/robomaze
source venvremote/bin/activate

run:
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
and save the IP you get

run:
jupyter-lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser

open the link but switch the computer name with the IP - http://132.68.55.146/

if there is a problem with that search how to change jupyter notebook password
